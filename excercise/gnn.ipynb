    " After a long journey through the universe before reaching the earth, the cosmic particles interact with the galactic magnetic field $B$.\n",
    " As these particles carry a charge $q$ they are deflected in the field by the Lorentz force $F = q \\cdot v × B$.\n",
    " Sources of cosmic particles are located all over the sky, thus arrival distributions of the cosmic particles are isotropic in general. However, particles originating from the same source generate on top of the isotropic\n",
    " arrival directions, street-like patterns from galactic magnetic field deflections.\n",
    "\n",
    " In this tasks we want to classify whether a simulated set of $500$ arriving cosmic particles contains street-like patterns (signal), or originates from an isotropic background.\n",
    "\n",
    " Training graph networks can be computationally demanding, thus, we recommend to use a GPU for this task."

    " GNNs classifiers are frequently build in a two step process: First MessagePassingLayers( aka Graph [Convolutional Layers](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#convolutional-layers) ) update the nodes. These exploit the local information. Then, the nodes are aggregated using [Pooling Layers](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#pooling-layers), reducing the graph to a single feature vector. This feature vector is then passed through a FFN to get the classification output.\n",
    " Have a look at the documentation of [EdgeConv](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#torch_geometric.nn.conv.EdgeConv) and [DynamicEdgeConv](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#torch_geometric.nn.conv.DynamicEdgeConv).\n",
