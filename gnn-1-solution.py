# # GNN Warmeup
# For this exercise we will learn to use `pytorch_geometric`` to run GNNs.
# The library comes with a comprehensive [documentation](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/introduction.html) and not only provides tools to handle graphs but also provides a large set of GNN specific layers and dataset.

# ## Task 1.1
# [Data Handling of Graphs](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/introduction.html#data-handling-of-graphs) offers a nice introduction into handling graphs.
# Implement the following graphs with features [1,2,...,n]:
# - cyclic graph (each nodes connects to the next) with 5 nodes
# - binary tree with 7 nodes over three leaves
